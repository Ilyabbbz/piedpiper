          The Problem
        </h2>
        <p>
          Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
          other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
          knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our
          privacy and freedom.
        </p>
        <p>But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:</p>
        <p>
          An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage
          powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation,
          and end-to-end encryption.
        </p>
        <p>Put even simpler — it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="fon2-section">
        <p>
          We’re in this together! All of our computers and phones join in a
          network to make the strongest supercomputer the world has ever seen.
